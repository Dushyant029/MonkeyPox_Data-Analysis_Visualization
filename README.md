# MonkeyPox_Data-Analysis_Visualization

## Introduction ðŸ”°

According to recent reports, a new illness known as monkey pox is spreading from one nation to another. The virus that causes monkey pox is not a novel one; it has previously existed. When two outbreaks of a disease resembling the pox appeared in a group of monkeys maintained for research in 1958, the disease was first identified as monkey pox and was given that name.

Later in the 1970s, when it began to affect people in central and western Africa, scientists discovered that it is a zoonotic disease, or one that spreads from animals to humans, and that it is brought on by an oval-shaped virus from the same family as the viruses that cause smallpox and cowpox. Although these microbes were initially discovered in monkeys, they can also be found in other animals, particularly rodents.


## How do People Catch the Infection? ðŸ¤”

Well, animal to human transmission can happen from direct contact with the blood, bodily fluids, or mucosa of infected animals. Eating undercooked meat from infected animals can also contribute to catching this infection. Once that happens, in a few weeks or so, the person starts to experience flu-like symptoms like fever, chills, muscle pain, headaches, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. A potential explanation for why this disease is now present in other nations throughout the world is that such a person can transfer it to others if they don't isolate themselves during the infection period and come into touch with others.


## Why has Monkeypox Re-emerged? ðŸ˜£

Since smallpox and monkeypox viruses are related, it was a kind of requirement to take smallpox vaccines to prevent it nearly 40 years ago, and since smallpox and monkeypox infections are contagious, the vaccines also protected against monkey pox infection, but since smallpox has been eradicated from the world, the new generation no longer needs these vaccines so..
